;; strike: When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an "X" on a scoresheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.
;; Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
;; Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
;; Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins
;; The total score from these throws is:
;; Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
;; Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
;; TOTAL = 28

;; Two consecutive strikes are referred to as a "double".
;; A double's pinfall is:
;; Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
;; Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
;; Frame 3, ball 1: 9 pins
;; Frame 3, ball 2: 0 pins (recorded as a dash '-' on the scoresheet)
;; The total score from these throws is:
;; Frame one: 10 + (10 + 9) = 29
;; Frame two: 10 + (9 + 0) = 19
;; Frame three: 9 + 0 = 9
;; TOTAL = 57
;; Three strikes bowled consecutively are known as a "turkey" or "triple".
;; A turkey's pinfall is:
;; Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
;; Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
;; Frame 3, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
;; Frame 4, ball 1: 0 pins (Gutterball)
;; Frame 4, ball 2: 9 pins
;; The total score from these throws is:
;; Frame one: 10 + (10 + 10) = 30
;; Frame two: 10 + (10 + 0) = 20
;; Frame three: 10 + (0 + 9) = 19
;; Frame four: 0 + 9 = 9
;; TOTAL = 78
;; Longer strings of strikes are called by various names, including "-Bagger" (Four Bagger) and "-Pack" (Six Pack) depending on local use, equipment, and exposure to the sport.[22][23] Recently, the event of bowling four consecutive strikes has also been called a "hambone".[24] Six strikes and nine strikes in a row can also be referred to "Wild Turkeys" and "Golden Turkeys" respectively. Any string of strikes starting in the first frame or ending "off the sheet" (where all of a bowler's shots from a certain frame to the end of the game strike) are often referred to as the "front" or "back" strikes, respectively (e.g. the "front nine" for strikes in frames 1â€“9, or the "back six" for strikes in frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). A "perfect game" or 12 strikes in a row is also rarely referred to as the "Thanksgiving Turkey". A "Clean Game" is a game with strikes or spares in every frame (not counting bonus balls).
;; A player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so:
;; Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
;; Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
;; Frame 3, ball 1: 4 pins
;; Frame 3, ball 2: 2 pins
;; The score from these throws are:
;; Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4) = 24
;; Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16
;; Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6
;; TOTAL = 46
